//java script is asynchronous by default
//synchronous code is executed in the order it is written

//it is an single threaded language 
//it can only do one thing at a time

// @ execution context - 
// @ Blocking Code - 
//      1. block the flow of execution 2. Read file synchronously
//      3. Write file synchronously
//@ Non-blocking Code -
//  1. does not block the flow of execution 2. Read file asynchronously
//  3. Write file asynchronously
